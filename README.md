<h1>
E-Commerce Application
</h1>

I designed and developed a sophisticated backend solution using microservice architecture to power an e-commerce platform. 
This involved breaking down the system's functionalities into independent services, such as product management, 
order processing, inventory management, and notifications, to ensure high scalability and enhanced reliability.

Key Achievements:
Utilized Spring Boot and Docker to streamline deployment processes, resulting in a remarkable reduction in deployment time and significantly improved scalability.
Integrated Apache Kafka to facilitate efficient service-to-service communication, thereby fortifying the system's message-driven architecture and resilience.
